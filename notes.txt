tk window for setting up (entering ip)
then a new one for the rest (once connected)
`setup()
 while 1:
 	Main().mainloop()`
this way when close main tk window, it stays alive and keeps recving images






"Copy latest to prev" 
	move the open() f variable to self.
	so that doesnt need to reopen everytime
	maybe doesnt work? idk
